I copy-pasted most of this code from this(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Sr-9JPD32QyNsRZcTng_L3FSqlnWNZTi78H429frDE/edit) person's guide.

This mod includes three items -> Rag(melee item), Barnes(gun), Statue(projectile + ammo). It will be expanded upon in the future but for now this is just a fun little thing I did to learn how to do projectiles. Sound and other "cards" will be in future patches(haha).

If you actually want to use this, drag the .tmod file into your mods folder under documents.
